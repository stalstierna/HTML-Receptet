        ><strong>Note: </strong>Use only the ripest tomatoes. Don't use a bread
        that's too flavorful (no sourdough, for example) or rough. You want it
        to soften and blend into the soup completely. You can serve the soup as
        is with a drizzle of olive oil, sherry vinegar, and a sprinkle of chives
        and ground black pepper, or you can add a few diced vegetables back to
        the smooth base for texture.</em

    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine tomatoes, cucumber, onion, pepper, garlic, and salt in a large
        bowl and toss to coat thoroughly. Let sit at room temperature for 30
        minutes. Drain juices into a large bowl and add the bread. Transfer the
        drained vegetables to a rimmed baking sheet and place in freezer until
        vegetables are frozen, about 30 minute.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Remove vegetables from freezer and allow to sit at room temperature
        until mostly thawed, about 30 minutes. Transfer vegetables and all their
        juices from the pan to bowl with soaked bread.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Working in two batches as necessary, blend vegetables, juice, and bread
        at high speed, slowly drizzling olive oil and sherry vinegar into
        blender as it blends. Strain soup through a fine mesh strainer into a
        large bowl. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Serve, drizzling
        each bowl with olive oil, a few sprinkles of sherry vinegar, extra
        cracked black pepper, and chives. Gazpacho can be stored in an airtight
        container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
